* **Inventory Management**

  * Real-time full/empty cylinder tracking
  * Server-enforced consistency rules
* **Transaction & Billing**

  * Sales processing
  * Automated invoice generation
  * Email dispatch
* **Audit & Compliance**

  * Immutable action logging
  * Role-based access enforcement
* **Reporting & Analytics**

  * Filterable transaction history
  * Exportable administrative reports

## 3️⃣ Design Principles & Goals

1. **Strict frontend/backend separation**
   UI never owns business truth.
2. **Offline-first reliability**
   Field operations continue regardless of connectivity.
3. **Backend-owned invariants**
   Inventory, pricing, and numbering are server-controlled.
4. **Auditability by design**
   All critical actions are logged.
5. **Role-based access control**
   Clear Admin vs Sales responsibility boundaries.
6. **Operational portability**
   Dockerized, environment-driven deployment.

## 7️⃣ Backend Architecture

### 7.1 Configuration

* Environment-based settings (`.env`)
* MySQL with `STRICT_TRANS_TABLES`
* JWT authentication (SimpleJWT)
* CORS enabled for SPA
* Modular Django apps per domain

### 7.2 Domain Services

| Service                 | Responsibility                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **TransactionService**  | Pricing, totals, inventory deduction |
| **DistributionService** | Batch creation, inventory movement   |
| **BillingService**      | PDF generation and email             |
| **ReportService**       | Filtered reporting                   |
| **AuditService**        | Action logging                       |

### 7.3 Security Model

* JWT authentication
* Role-based permissions at view level
* Atomic inventory updates
* Server-generated identifiers
* Audit logging on sensitive mutations

---

## 8️⃣ Frontend Architecture

* React SPA (Vite)
* React Router v7 (loaders/actions)
* TailwindCSS (mobile-first)
* `offline.js` — LocalStorage queue
* `usePrinter.js` — ESC/POS printing
* Root layout manages routing, auth state, and layout shell

**Offline strategy:**
Mutations are queued locally and replayed automatically when connectivity is restored.

---

## 9️⃣ Transaction Data Flow (High Level)

```
User
 ↓
React UI
 ↓
Router Action
 ↓
[Offline? → Local Queue]
 ↓
Backend API
 ↓
Domain Service
 ↓
MySQL (atomic commit)
 ↓
AuditLog
 ↓
Frontend confirmation + optional printing
```

---

## 🔟 Deployment Model

* Docker Compose orchestrates:

  * `frontend` (5173)
  * `backend` (8000)
  * `db` (3306)
* Persistent volumes for MySQL
* Secrets managed via `.env`

**Bootstrap:**

```bash
docker-compose up --build
docker exec -it backend bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Offline & Printing Strategy

* Local queue for unsynced writes
* Automatic replay on reconnect
* Immediate ESC/POS receipt printing
* Printing isolated from persistence logic

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Key System Characteristics

* Decoupled architecture
* Offline-first resilience
* Backend-owned business truth
* Thermal printing support
* Automated billing
* Audit-ready compliance
* ACID-safe inventory & transactions

## 1️⃣ Transaction Creation Flow

### Intent

Create a sales transaction with optional offline handling and receipt printing.

```
User
 │
 ▼
React UI
 │
 ▼
Router Action
 │
 ├─ Offline → Queue locally
 │
 └─ Online → POST /api/transactions/
        │
        ▼
   DRF View
        │
        ▼
TransactionService
        │
        ▼
MySQL (atomic commit)
        │
        ▼
AuditLog
        │
        ▼
Response JSON
 │
 ▼
UI Update → Optional Print
```

**Notes**

* All mutations flow through router actions
* Pricing and inventory logic is backend-owned
* Printing is post-commit and non-blocking

---

## 2️⃣ Delivery / Distribution Batch Flow

### Intent

Create a delivery or empty-return batch with backend-generated identifiers.

```
User
 │
 ▼
React UI
 │
 ▼
Router Action
 │
 ├─ Offline → Save batch locally
 │
 └─ Online → POST /api/distributions/
        │
        ▼
DistributionService
        │
        ├─ Generate distribution_no
        ├─ Apply inventory movement
        ▼
MySQL (atomic commit)
        │
        ▼
AuditLog
 │
 ▼
UI Confirmation → Print (optional)
```

**Notes**

* Batch operations are atomic
* Inventory changes are server-enforced
* Printing never blocks persistence

---

## 3️⃣ Failure & Recovery Pattern

```
Network / API Failure
        ↓
Router Action catches error
        ↓
Offline queue persists payload
        ↓
UI indicates "Saved Offline"
        ↓
Network restored
        ↓
Queued mutations replayed
        ↓
Backend commits & audits
```

---

## 4️⃣ Architectural Strengths

* Clear trust boundaries
* No UI-owned invariants
* Offline-safe by construction
* Side effects isolated
* Highly testable flows
* Compliance-ready audit trail
